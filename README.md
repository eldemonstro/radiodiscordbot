# radiodiscordbot

That bot plays web radios  
You must have ffmpeg installed  
To test if your radio is compatible play a `ffplay link_to_your_radio`, if you can listen fine the bot will go fine  
While running: type `/join` and the bot will join the voice channel you are in, `/leave` will make the bot exit the channel  
`ping` makes the bot respond `pong`
